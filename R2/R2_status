Progress:
    We were able to meet our requirements for the most part, with us completing the installation, obstacle detection, and danger 
bar.  However, we were unable to complete the Alert System requirement where we were to create a noise or notification based on 
the obstacle detection.
    This requirement would need more testing on the actual device (the clientâ€™s computer, or mobile device) as the libraries 
used may change depending on the device.  	Once this is achieved however, this should not be too difficult to complete as 
all that would need to be added would be an additional line or two of code for the danger level check within main.py.
    For the completed requirements, as seen in image_1.png, we have successfully been able to create a working obstacle detection 
algorithm that will be able to output a danger signal on a 3-level scale when processing an image.
